The design incorporates clever interlocking tabs and nesting geometries to ensure stability and structural integrity without the use of joinery, glue, or hardware.\n\n**Total Dimensions:**  \nThe chair measures approximately 600 mm (L) × 500 mm (W) × 800 mm (H).\n\n**Constraint Check:**  \nNo additional materials, adhesives, or fabrication processes were assumed. The design respects the cardboard's natural behavior, including its thickness, rigidity, and allowable fold radius.

Instead, you design within its constraints, using origami principles to unlock strength, flexibility, and form without the need for joinery or adhesives.\n\nDesign style is rooted in origami geometry using only cardboard—no glue, no hardware. Forms emerge from a limited number of precise folds and creases, creating load-bearing volumes from flat material. Each object exhibits sharp planar facets, angular symmetry, and structural clarity. The aesthetic draws from minimalism, parametric folding logic, and analog craft intelligence, similar to Gehry’s Easy Edges or MisoSoupDesign’s Ripple—but stripped down to pure paper tectonics.\n\nEvery crease is intentional. Every fold is both structure and expression.
